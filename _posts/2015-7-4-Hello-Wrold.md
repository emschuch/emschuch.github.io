title: Hello, Wrold!
---

Hello, wrold! I'm Emily, currently studying data science at Metis, an intensive twelve week bootcamp program in NYC.

Yes, that's a typo in the title. The first program, code, or blog post that most people write is called 'Hello, World.' I had a programming teacher who taught us to write 'Hello Wrold' as a reminder that we're not going to do everything perfectly the first time, but it's important not to get discouraged by that. There will be typos, there will be bugs, there will be error messages. To learn we need to try things, we make mistakes, we fix them, and hopefully this process teaches us not to repeat those mistakes in the future.
