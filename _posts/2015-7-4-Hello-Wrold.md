title: Hello, Wrold!
---

Yes, that's a typo in the title. Hello, wrold! I'm Emily Schuch, currently studying data science at Metis, an intensive twelve week bootcamp program in NYC.

The first program, code, or blog post that most people write is called 'Hello, World.' I had a teacher who instead taught us to write 'Hello Wrold,' as a reminder that we're not going to do everything perfectly the first time. When learning new things, it's important not to get discouraged by that. There will be typos, there will be bugs, there will be error messages. To learn we need to try things, we make mistakes, we fix them, and hopefully this process teaches us not to repeat those mistakes in the future.

I'm looking forward to learning new things and I hope you'll come back to this blog to see what I'm up to. You can see more of my work on my portfolio website at [emilyschuch.com](http://www.emilyschuch.com/)
