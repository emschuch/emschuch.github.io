I'm both a creative and analytical thinker who enjoys finding stories in data. I started this blog while studying data science at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, a 12 week intensive course in NYC. As an artist & designer who always excelled at math, my initial interest in data science was fueled by a love of data visualization. I came to Metis to deepen my quantitative skills after nearly a decade as a visual strategist in branding.
